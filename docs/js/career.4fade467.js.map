As I gained experience with the technology and the client, I was moved into a tech lead position. As a consultant, we worked with the client to customize NexJ's core Customer Relationship product and tailor it to suite the client's needs. I worked directly with analysts and other developers to gather requirements, plan projects, estimate deliverables and design solutions. \r\n     </p>\r\n    <p>   \r\n      As a Tech lead for a team of developers, we strived towards incorporating continuous delivery and agile development methodologies into our work efforts. It was my responsibility to ensure all client deliverables were met and the project release went according to plan.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Code reviews were an essential part of my responsibilities. I was consulted with each change to the project and had visibility to all code changes. My experience and domain knowledge of the project was crucial in guiding developers towards making the correct code change. Frequent one on one sessions with developers were necessary in order to transfer my knowledge and give detailed explanations as to why or how a certain change will be done. Enforcing best practices and coding techniques ensured a limited amount of defects and bugs would occur and the performance and stability of the system was not negatively affected.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      My time at NexJ provided valuable experience in a wide range of technologies. It was necessary for a developer in my position to be able to triage issues from the back end database all the way to the front end user interface. The core framework for the model was mainly developed in Java. The product model and customizations were done using Scheme within the NexJ development studio. \r\n    </p>\r\n    <h3>Projects</h3>\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li>WORM</li>\r\n      <li>Client Overview Dashboard</li>\r\n      <li>Required Documentation</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <h3>Technologies</h3>\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li>Java/Java EE</li>\r\n      <li>XML - SOAP, NexJ Studio Metadata</li>\r\n      <li>Scheme</li>\r\n      <li>Websphere MQ</li>\r\n      <li>Javascript</li>\r\n      <li>Oracle 11g/12c</li>\r\n      <li>Microsoft SQL Server</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    \r\n    <h2>FDM Group Inc.</h2>\r\n    <h3>Overview</h3>\r\n    <p>\r\n        FDM Group offered services to hire young professionals looking to kick start their career in Technology. I enrolled in the Java Training Program, which was a 4 month program that focused on learning java and the expectations of a consultant in the technology industry, including both technological skills and professional skills.\r\n    </p>\r\n        The training had a very steep learning curve. Thanks to my background in Computer Science, I was able to excel in the training course and benefit from all the experience FDM had to offer. Through a series of classes and projects, it was my responsibility to ensure the projects were completed correctly and to the best of my ability. Each project tested our knowledge in a particular area, including Java (Object modeling, MVC, 4 pillars), Bash Shell scripts, Oracle SQL, XML, HTML, CSS and Javascript.\r\n    <p>\r\n        For the final project, I cooperatively lead a team of 10 developers to design and implement a Route Planning web application. By applying the skills we learned throughout the program, we had to finish under challenging time constraints and present to the academy and peers. \r\n    </p>\r\n    <h3>Projects</h3>\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li>Route Planning</li>\r\n      <li>Trading Platform</li>\r\n      <li>Currency Converter</li>\r\n      <li>Safe Remove Script</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <h3>Technologies</h3>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li>Java/Java EE</li>\r\n        <li>XML</li>\r\n        <li>Javascript/HTML/CSS</li>\r\n        <li>Oracle 11g</li>\r\n        <li>Bash Shell Script</li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n  </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<style scoped>\r\nh1 {\r\n  color: #8180b9;\r\n  font-size: 36px;\r\n}\r\n\r\nh2 {\r\n  color: #8180b9;\r\n  font-size: 32px;\r\n}\r\n</style>\r\n","import { render } from \"./Career.vue?vue&type=template&id=4976cfec&scoped=true\"\nconst script = {}\n\nimport \"./Career.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=4976cfec&scoped=true&lang=css\"\nscript.render = render\nscript.__scopeId = \"data-v-4976cfec\"\n\nexport default script","<template>\r\n  <div class=\"education\">\r\n    <h1>Education</h1>\r\n    <h3>BSc.

In this paper we will use another algorithm, \r\n        namely particle swarm optimization, to train the network on two datasets of varying complexity to determine its applicability \r\n        as a neural network training algorithm.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h3>Technologies Used</h3>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>Microsoft Visual Studio 2008</li>\r\n        <li>C#</li>\r\n        <li>LaTeX - Used to write reports</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Learning Object: Quiz-O-Matic 5000</h2>\r\n    <h3>General Information</h3>\r\n    <p>The overall task of the learning object was to teach and test mathematical concepts at a specific grade level. The grades I aimed \r\n        to focus were grade 9 and grade 10 at the Academic level. The grade 9 information is more towards the material found at the end\r\n        of the grade 9 course. I found the transition from end of grade 9 into grade 10 to be smooth and flow nicely with the material. The \r\n        information for teaching material was found in The Ontario Curriculum, Grade 9 and 10: Mathematics.\r\n        This project tested both my understanding of linear algebraic expressions and equations, as well as my ability to program in Visual \r\n        Basic. The need for this to be a learning tool forced me to take an alternative approach to coming up with an application.  Instead of \r\n        focusing on the purely technical details, I had to envision the full user experience and design a UI in such a way that it made learning the material easy for anyone. \r\n    </p>\r\n    <h3>Technologies Used</h3>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>Microsoft Visual Studio 2008</li>\r\n        <li>Visual Basic</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Space Animation</h2>\r\n    <h3>General Information</h3>\r\n    <p>This space animation project was the final project in my graphics class. We were required to make a short animation from the techniques \r\n        and tools learned throughout the course. The models were all manually created using Milkshape 3D and exported to an ASCII file which \r\n        included the coordinates and shape details. The main program parses the ASCII files and build the model in OpenGL in order to render the \r\n        shapes. It is a 35 second long animation of an alien space ship coming around a planet and shooting another spaceship, causing it to explode. \r\n    </p>\r\n    <h3>Technologies Used</h3>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>C</li>\r\n        <li>OpenGL, GLUT- Open source library to display graphics</li>\r\n        <li>Milkshape 3D - Create graphic models to use in animations</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Galaxy Identification Expert System Shell (GIESS)</h2>\r\n    <h3>General Information</h3>\r\n    <p>GIESS is a project developed in Prolog which implemented an expert system to classify galaxies based on appearance. It uses a knowledge base \r\n        which defines rules and relationships for existing galaxies, and through a series of questions, the user narrows down the selection until one \r\n        is chosen. Research had to be done on existing galaxies in order to create the knowledge base and ensure it's accuracy. Existing classification \r\n        techniques were used in constructing the knowledge base. \r\n    </p>\r\n    <h3>Technologies Used</h3>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>Prolog</li>\r\n        <li>Galaxy Zoo</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n  </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<style scoped>\r\nh1 {\r\n  color: #8180b9;\r\n  font-size: 36px;\r\n}\r\n\r\nh2 {\r\n  color: #8180b9;\r\n  font-size: 32px;\r\n}\r\n</style>","import { render } from \"./Education.vue?vue&type=template&id=380de12b&scoped=true\"\nconst script = {}\n\nimport \"./Education.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=380de12b&scoped=true&lang=css\"\nscript.render = render\nscript.__scopeId = \"data-v-380de12b\"\n\nexport default script","export * from \"-!../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-0!../../node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-1!../../node_modules/@vue/cli-service/node_modules/vue-loader-v16/dist/stylePostLoader.js!../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-2!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/@vue/cli-service/node_modules/vue-loader-v16/dist/index.js??ref--0-1!./Career.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=4976cfec&scoped=true&lang=css\"","<template>\r\n  <div class=\"projects\">\r\n    <h1>Projects</h1>\r\n    <p>Coming soon</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</template>\r\n","import { render } from \"./Projects.vue?vue&type=template&id=5a401f4a\"\nconst script = {}\nscript.render = render\n\nexport default script"],"sourceRoot":""}
