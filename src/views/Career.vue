    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>
        My role at NexJ started out as a contractor and quickly turned into a Consulting position. As I gained experience with the technology and the client, I was moved into a tech lead position. As a consultant, we worked with the client to customize NexJ's core Customer Relationship product and tailor it to suite the client's needs. I worked directly with analysts and other developers to gather requirements, plan projects, estimate deliverables and design solutions. 
     </p>
    <p>   
      As a Tech lead for a team of developers, we strived towards incorporating continuous delivery and agile development methodologies into our work efforts. It was my responsibility to ensure all client deliverables were met and the project release went according to plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Code reviews were an essential part of my responsibilities. I was consulted with each change to the project and had visibility to all code changes. My experience and domain knowledge of the project was crucial in guiding developers towards making the correct code change. Frequent one on one sessions with developers were necessary in order to transfer my knowledge and give detailed explanations as to why or how a certain change will be done. Enforcing best practices and coding techniques ensured a limited amount of defects and bugs would occur and the performance and stability of the system was not negatively affected.
    </p>
    <p>
      My time at NexJ provided valuable experience in a wide range of technologies. It was necessary for a developer in my position to be able to triage issues from the back end database all the way to the front end user interface. The core framework for the model was mainly developed in Java. The product model and customizations were done using Scheme within the NexJ development studio.

    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>
        FDM Group offered services to hire young professionals looking to kick start their career in Technology. I enrolled in the Java Training Program, which was a 4 month program that focused on learning java and the expectations of a consultant in the technology industry, including both technological skills and professional skills.
    </p>
    <p>
        The training had a very steep learning curve. Thanks to my background in Computer Science, I was able to excel in the training course and benefit from all the experience FDM had to offer. Through a series of classes and projects, it was my responsibility to ensure the projects were completed correctly and to the best of my ability. Each project tested our knowledge in a particular area, including Java (Object modeling, MVC, 4 pillars), Bash Shell scripts, Oracle SQL, XML, HTML, CSS and Javascript.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the final project, I cooperatively lead a team of 10 developers to design and implement a Route Planning web application. By applying the skills we learned throughout the program, we had to finish under challenging time constraints and present to the academy and peers.
